What does the project do:
  
  This project is a program that allows businesses to better organize their inventory. This app allows for easier access to
every object in the inventory, filter by date/name and any other useful feature, easy scan process (by redirecting focus on 
screen for non-stop scanning around the storage room). Also, it reports missing items, allows comment sections, insertions,
deletions and and login-in system as well as a "how to use" guide.

Who is the project for?
  
  The project was made for the Davidson College Biology Department but it is applicable to many businesses taht struggle 
organizing their inventories (maybe because of many storage units, large amount of objects, not many employees etc)

How does it work?
  
  The program works works by using JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the front-end and SQL for database support. The whole thing is 
currently hosted in a local environment but I am working into getting it uploaded to a domain.
